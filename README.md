## General Description
The "BIMCAP Plugin" for Autodesk Revit is designed to help users efficiently manage their Revit projects and the "Isolate Warnings" tool will help you isolate elements on different view to resolve them with different filter types within their Revit projects. This tool provides several key features to enhance the user's workflow:

- **Get All Warning Types**: Retrieve a list of all warning types present in the current Revit document, helping in identifying and categorizing different types of warnings.
- **Open Version Information**: Access the plugin version and release date through a simple dialog box.
- **Open Website**: Quick link to the BIMCAP website for additional resources and support.
- **Isolate Warnings**: Provides a user interface to isolate elements based on the selected warning types. Users can select a view and isolate elements that generate specific warnings, making it easier to address and resolve issues.

### How to Use:

1. **Version**:
- Navigate to the plugin menu and select "Version".
- A dialog box will display the plugin version and release date.

2. **Website**:
- Navigate to the plugin menu and select "BIMCAP".
- The BIMCAP website will open in your default web browser.

3. **Isolate Warnings**:
- Navigate to the plugin menu and select "Isolate Warnings".
- A window will open where you can see all the warning types listed that are present in the current project.
- **Select Warning Types**: Select any number of warning types that you want to target.
- **Select an Action**:
     - **Temporarily Isolate Elements**: Isolate the selected elements in the current view only.
     - **Create New View**: Create a new view and hide all other elements to better highlight the warning elements.
     - **Create Multiple New Views**: Create multiple new views for individual warning types and hide all other elements to better highlight the warning elements associated with each warning type.
     - **Prefix and Suffix for New Views**: Add a prefix and suffix for each new view created, helping you organize and identify the views easily.
     - **Color Override**: Apply a color override to the targeted elements, making it easier to focus on and resolve the warnings. This will automatically create a new view for better understanding.
